# Cplusplus-Program
# Project 3 Corner Grocer

+ Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Project was solving the problem a company was having, They needed to know how often items are purchased. The Program does the following:
    * Produces a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
    * Produces a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
    * Produces a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

+ What did you do particularly well?
  I integrated C++ and Python in the most effiecient way based on both of the programs. I also believed I made the code easy to read for potential coders who may work on the       code after me to enchance or change it. I also think I made the displayed information easy to read for the user by keeping the list and histogram fairly simple. I also used     different colors on the user end to make it easy to read input validation promps and error messages. The color also made it alittle more fun. 

+ Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One way to enhance code could be to make an input method for the orginal text file so the file could be a living document and you could have live data. You could also use it     for items other than produce to see what needs to be purchased by the grocery store. Another simple fix would be have an inventory document at the begining of the day and you   can edit that document while making the new one so you can have a current in-store item document and a what was bought in the day document both would help ordering items. 
  
+ Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Some of the issues I was having didnt just have to do with coding but errors as well I wanted to make  whole new integrated solution and I wa having trouble setting it up so I   just went to my old one and step by step went through what I did to make that one work. I couldn't use the document from the earlier modules to help me because that didnt even   help me back then. One thing I was having problems with was adding the text file to the same folders so it could be read. for some reason it wasnt working so I added it as       source instead and that seemed to work and I actually like that better. I did have some issues with the python code and reading from text file and making a dat file but I       think that stem from the issue stated above. I did use github to help me by viewing other users solutions. I think a tool I am adding to my support network is not being         hesitant to try new things that may work easier for me or even not being hesitant to look at solutions to things other people may have encountered. Also practicing setting up   a integrated solution is only going to help me be smoother with it in the future and not spend so much time trying to figure it out.
  
+ What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Some of the skills that this project helped me with that will be transferable are being smoother with setting up my projects. Being more comfortable with using resources at my   disposal. Also more specific is reading and writing to a document in python will be helpful in the future as well as making Menus in C++. I actually had fun messing around       with the colors. I know its simple but sometimes the smallest things bring you the most joy with coding. 
  
+ How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This program is maintable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing industry best standards when it comes to variable naming conventions, comments that are easy to understand. The   code is also simple enough to were you wouldnt have to change much to utilize it for a different program or solution. The code is also easy to understand and very simple         syntax.
